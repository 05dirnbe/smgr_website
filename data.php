    <p>For now, you may expect listed data sets to consist of a set of <strong>raw images</strong> obtained in the lab and associated <strong>graph representation</strong> that encode the network-like structures depicted in the images. Detailed descriptions of experimental setups as well as how the graphs were obtained shall accompany the data.</p>
