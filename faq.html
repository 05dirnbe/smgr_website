    <h3 id="question_1">What kind of data can I find in this repository?</h3>

    <p>As of now we envision this repository to contain high-quality, research-grade experimental data revolving around slime molds alongside a detailed description of how the data was obtained. For example, our contribution consists of images and graphs extracted from those images. It comes with detailed descriptions of the underlying experiments and settings used to obtain the data including instructions on how to reproduce it.</p>

    <h3 id="question_2">What quality level can I expect of the data?</h3>

    <p>In this repository we aim to collect data and links to data that are up to scientific standards. That is data that has been or is going to be the foundation of some peer-reviewed scientific publication. As a result, expect most of the data in this repository to highly specialized.</p>

    <h3 id="question_3">Is this repository limited to data that can be turned into graphs?</h3>

    <p>The short answer is: For now it is.</p>

    <p>The long answer is more complicated since we do not know how this repository is going to be received by the scientific community. If there is a strong feedback and people are approaching us with various types of high quality data we are more than willing to adapt the scope of the repository.</p>

    <h3 id="question_4">Why should I contribute to this repository?</h3>

    <p>To increase the visibility and value of your data as well as to improve the reproducibility of your results.</p>

    <h3 id="question_5">I do have some data I want to contribute. Can you host my data for me?</h3>

    <p>Absolutely, its good to see that you are willing to trust us with you valuable data (keep a backup though). Please contact us in order to discuss your contribution.</p>

    <h3 id="question_6">Do I have to give up control over my data?</h3>

    <p>Not necessarily, you are always the owner of your data. If you don't want your data on our servers, then just provide them on your own web-space and submit the associated links to us.</p>

    <h3 id="question_7">Is there a downside to me contributing?</h3>

    <p>Well, making your data public carries the risk of someone else coming up with a brilliant idea of how to use it that didn't occur to you. However, you will still be credited as the origin of the data.</p>

    <h3 id="question_8">Can I simply download and use the data I find here?</h3>

    <p>Yes you can, that is about the whole point. However, do give appropriate credit to the original contributor of the data as required by the rules of good scientific practice. Mentioning this repository is not mandatory, but highly recommended.</p>

    <h3 id="question_9">I'd like to follow the development of this repository. How can you keep me up to date?</h3>

    <p>Simply sign up to our mailing list. It will be used to distribute announcements of new data being added or other important changes about the repository.</p>

    <h3 id="question_10">My question is not on the list! How can I reach you?</h3>

    By all means do <a href="contact.html">contact</a> us. This whole project is just in its infancy and we have never done something remotely like it. Hence it is to be expected that we forget about all kinds of important issues. Please to point them out to us. Any sort of help or suggestions are highly appreciated.
