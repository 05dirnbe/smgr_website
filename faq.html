  <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

  <h3>
      Sharing data:
  </h3>
  <ul>
      <li>
          Why bother using the SMGR?
      </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
      The impact of data sharing as a scientific practice is ever increasing. The SMGR seeks to promote data reuse by enabling reproduction of results and acting
      as a catalyst for new research efforts. Making your data accessible for everyone renders it more visible and potentially increases its impact beyond
      initial publication, possibly beyond its domain of origin. As the impact of your hard-earned data grows, your impact grows.
  </p>
  <ul>
      <li>
          What kind of data does the SMGR accept?
      </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
      Currently the SMGR accepts all data that is concerned with networks formed by slime molds. This includes images of slime molds networks and graphs of the
      same in particular but is not limited to them. Such data can take various forms and we do not enforce any given file formats as to not restrict the
      flexibility of the repository. However, we ask contributors to adhere to the standards of their fields.
  </p>
  <p>
      · I am considering a submission, but I am not sure whether my data is interesting for the SMGR. What can I do?
  </p>
  <p>
      If you are in doubt, simply contact us. We can discuss your data and find out whether it is a good fit for the SMGR. Contacting us early helps us to
      coordinate and help you throughout the submission process.
  </p>
  <ul>
      <li>
          What should a submission contain?
      </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
      We aim to encourage reuse of existing data resulting in increased credit for original work. To facilitate this, it is important that submitted data is well
      documented and in a format the community commonly uses. Submitters are encouraged to provide data and descriptive information such that another researcher
      would be able to evaluate previous findings based on submitted data This includes raw data as well as any data derived from it. In general submission
      should include the following:
  </p>
  <p>
      o A statement naming the authors, relevant publications the data was used in, how-to-cite, additional information as well as license agreement if
      applicable.
  </p>
  <p>
      o A concise summary of the contents of the set. The scope and relevance of the data should be made clear.
  </p>
  <p>
      o A detailed description of the contents of the set.
  </p>
  <p>
      o A detailed description of the materials and methods used produce the set.
  </p>
  <p>
      o The dataset itself. For bigger datasets consisting of several subsets, a structured origination is advised.
  </p>
  <p>
      o Programs and code used to process the set.
  </p>
  <p>
      o Relevant suggestions of what could be done with the data.
  </p>
  <ul>
      <li>
          What about the quality of my submission?
      </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
      We expect submitted data to be part of some sort of reviewed scholarly publication. We trust that involved expert reviewers make sure that the data was
      produced according to relevant good scientific practice.
  </p>
  <p>
      · I have prepared a submission and am ready to submit. What happens next?
  </p>
  <p>
      Please let us know that you are ready. You will have to decide whether you want us to host your data on our servers, or whether we will only link to your
      server hosting the data. In the first case it suffices to provide us with the link and other relevant information. In the second case we will provide you
      with a link that enables us to upload you data for us to host.
  </p>
  <p>
      · What happens to my data after submission? Do I have to give up control over my data?
  </p>
  <p>
      After submission we will check whether your data is complete and sufficiently documented. If this is the case, we will add it to the data sets available
      via the SMGR project page.
  </p>
  <ul>
      <li>
          Can I retract my data from the SMGR?
      </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
      At any point in time your data remains your data and you can instruct us to remove it from the SMGR. This could be appropriate for example, if something
      was discovered that renders the data erroneous.
  </p>
  <ul>
      <li>
          Is the data in the SMGR being backed up?
      </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
      The data contained in the SMGR will be integrated in our institutes back-up system. A couple of hard-drives failing will not affect the integrity of the
      SMGR.
  </p>
  <p>
      · Are there any costs associated to sharing via SMGR?
  </p>
  <p>
      No, given the current small size and low maintenance of the SMGR, any fees are inappropriate at the moment.
  </p>
  <p>
      · Why are there no features such automatic submission system and search functions?
  </p>
  <p>
      The answer is, that the SMGR as it stands is simply too small to warrant such efforts. Given the estimated size of the research community interested in
      slime mold networks, it is probably foolish to expect a large amount of contributors out of the blue. As a result, the number of datasets will likely not
      exceed large numbers in the near future. Given these assumptions, features commonly found in larger repositories are simply overkill at the moment.
      However, such features may well be added in the future provided appropriate growth of the SMGR and associated community feedback. Even the large
      repositories have started small.
  </p>
  <h3>
      Using data:
  </h3>
  <p>
      · What kind of data can I expect to find in the SMGR?
  </p>
  <p>
      In the SMGR you will find data revolving around networks formed by slime molds. At present this includes images of such networks and equivalent graph
      representations. To get an overview on the data sets available, feel free to browse them here.
  </p>
  <ul>
      <li>
          How may SMGR data be reused?
      </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
      SMGR data may be reused in any way, provided license agreements and terms of use of individual data sets are observed. Reuse includes reproduction of known
      results as well as the realization of new data analysis approaches evolving previously unexplored research questions. When browsing data sets also look for
      documents indicating open research questions encountered by the contributors of the sets.
  </p>
  <ul>
      <li>
          How do I cite SMGR data?
      </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
      At present data sets in the SMGR are not citable entities. Please cite the scholarly publication the data set is associated with. Thus the original
      contributors are credited. Appropriate information can be found on the contributor’s page.
  </p>
  <ul>
      <li>
          What quality level can I expect of the data?
      </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
      You can expect the data in the SMGR be of research grade quality. All data has undergone a peer-review process. We thus trust expert reviewers to ensure
      that the quality of the data is on par with the standards of its field of origin.
  </p>
  <ul>
      <li>
          How to I get SMGR data?
      </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
      Simply go to our data set page, browse, select and download.
  </p>
  <p>
      · Are there any costs associated to using data contained in the SMGR?
  </p>
  <p>
      Due to the small size of the SMGR, there are no costs for its uses.
  </p>
  <h3>
