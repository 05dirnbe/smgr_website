                                    The impact of data sharing as a scientific practice is ever increasing.
                                    Making data available for everyone increases visibility of data creators, allows original results to be reproduced and puts data in a prime position to become a catalyst for novel research. Given the significant costs (time and resources) that are typically associated with obtaining high quality data, promoting increased reuse of data is an economical choice. 
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                    Researchers and other professionals that do not have the required resources/connections to produce/obtain their own data sets benefit in particular from repositories like the SMGR, since it provides immediate and convenient access to experimental material that would be hard to acquire by other means.

                                    In the SMGR you will find data revolving around network-forming slime molds.
                                    At present this includes images of such networks obtained in controlled wet-lab experiments and equivalent graph representations of said networks.

                                    The best way to find out what's in the SMGR is to check out the <a href="contributors.php">contributors</a> page or to skim through the data using our <a href="data.php">browsing functionality</a>.

                                    You can expect the data in the SMGR to be of research grade quality.
                                    All data is required to be part of some scholarly publication subject to a peer-review process.
                                    We thus trust the involved expert reviewers to ensure that the quality of the data
                                    is on par with the standards of its field of origin. In addition to that we will inspect data ourselves upon submission.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                    However, we are not in a position to guarantee that all SMGR data will be perfect always. We still strongly recommend that you carefully inspect any data that you want to use in order to convince yourself of its validity with respect to the intended use.

                                    For reasons of security our servers are configured such that they serve a limited number of requests (per unit time and IP address) and allow only a small number of simultaneously active downloads. While it is unlikely that the traffic exceeds the threshold values, we recommend to start the download again at a later time. It also helps to break the download into smaller chunks if possible.

                                        To facilitate this, it is important that submitted data is well documented and

                                        community commonly uses. Submitters are encouraged to provide data and
                                        descriptive information
                                        such that another researcher would be able to evaluate previous findings based
                                        on submitted data.
                                        This includes raw data as well as any data derived from it. In general
                                        submission should include

                                        The answer is, that the SMGR as it stands is simply too small to warrant such
                                        efforts.
                                        Given the very countable size of the research community interested in slime mold
                                        networks,
                                        it is probably foolish to expect a large amount of contributors out of the blue.
                                        As
                                        a result,
                                        the number of datasets will likely not exceed large numbers in the near future.
                                        Given these
                                        assumptions, features commonly found in larger repositories, such as automatic
                                        upload processes,
                                        are simply overkill at the moment. However, such features may well be added in
                                        the
                                        future provided
                                        appropriate growth of the SMGR and associated community feedback. Even large
                                        repositories
                                        have started small.
