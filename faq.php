                                    The impact of data sharing as a scientific practice is ever increasing.
                                    The SMGR seeks to promote data reuse by enabling reproduction of results. It may
                                    also act as a catalyst for new research efforts. Making your data accessible for
                                    everyone renders it more visible and potentially increases its impact beyond initial

                                        To facilitate this, it is important that submitted data is well documented and
                                        in a format the
                                        community commonly uses. Submitters are encouraged to provide data and
                                        descriptive information
                                        such that another researcher would be able to evaluate previous findings based
                                        on submitted data.
                                        This includes raw data as well as any data derived from it. In general
                                        submission should include

                                        The answer is, that the SMGR as it stands is simply too small to warrant such
                                        efforts.
                                        Given the very countable size of the research community interested in slime mold
                                        networks,
                                        it is probably foolish to expect a large amount of contributors out of the blue.
                                        As
                                        a result,
                                        the number of datasets will likely not exceed large numbers in the near future.
                                        Given these
                                        assumptions, features commonly found in larger repositories, such as automatic
                                        upload processes,
                                        are simply overkill at the moment. However, such features may well be added in
                                        the
                                        future provided
                                        appropriate growth of the SMGR and associated community feedback. Even large
                                        repositories
                                        have started small.
