    <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

    <h3>Why use the SMGR?</h3>

    <p>The impact of data sharing as a scientific practice is ever increasing. The SMGR seeks to promote data reuse by enabling reproduction of results. It may also act as a catalyst for new research efforts. Making your data accessible for everyone renders it more visible and potentially increases its impact beyond initial publication, possibly beyond its domain of origin. As the impact of your hard-earned data grows, your impact grows.</p>
        
    <h3>
        What kind of data does the SMGR accept?
    </h3>

    <p>Currently the SMGR accepts all data that is concerned with networks formed by slime molds. This includes images of slime molds networks and graphs of the same in particular but is not limited to them. Such data can take various forms and we do not enforce any given file formats as to not restrict the flexibility of the repository. However, we ask contributors to adhere to the standards of their fields.</p>

    <h3>I am considering a submission, but I am not sure whether my data is interesting to the SMGR. What can I do?</h3>

    <p>If you are in doubt, simply contact us. We can discuss your data and find out whether it is a good fit for the SMGR. Contacting us early helps us to coordinate and help you throughout the submission process.</p>
      
    <h3>What should a submission contain?</h3>

    <p>We aim to encourage reuse of existing data resulting in increased credit for original work. To facilitate this, it is important that submitted data is well documented and in a format the community commonly uses. Submitters are encouraged to provide data and descriptive information such that another researcher would be able to evaluate previous findings based on submitted data. This includes raw data as well as any data derived from it. In general submission should include the following:</p>
        
      <ul>
      <li>A statement naming the authors, relevant publications the data was used in, how-to-cite, additional information as well as license agreement if applicable.</li>
      <li>A concise summary of the contents of the set. The scope and relevance of the data should become clear immediately without reading the details.</li>
      <li>A detailed description of the contents of the set. This is aimed at people interested in the details.</li>
      <li>A detailed description of the materials and methods used produce the set. We welcome instructions that go beyond your average "Materials and Methods" sections.</li>
      <li>The dataset itself. For bigger datasets consisting of several subsets, a structured tree-like origination is advised as it will facilitate browsing and downloading the data lateron.</li>
      <li>Programs and code used to process or analyze the set.</li>
      <li>Relevant suggestions of what could be done with the data in the future.</li>
      </ul> 
    
    <h3>
      What about the quality of my submission?
    </h3>

    <p>We expect submitted data to be part of some peer-reviewed scholarly publication. We trust that involved expert reviewers make sure that the data was produced according to relevant standards.</p>
      
    <h3>
      I have prepared a submission and am ready to submit. What happens next?
    </h3>

    <p>Please let us know that you are ready. You will have to decide whether you want us to host your data on our servers, or whether you prefer us to put up a link to your server hosting the data. In the second case it suffices to provide us with the link and some relevant descriptive information. In the second case we will provide you with a link that enables us to upload you data for us to host.</p>
      
    <h3>
      What happens to my data after submission? Do I have to give up control over my data?
    </h3>

    <p>After submission we will check whether your data is complete and sufficiently documented. If this is the case, we will add it to the data sets available via the SMGR project page. People will then be able to browse and download easily from there.</p>
      
    <h3>
      Can I retract my data from the SMGR?
    </h3>

    <p>At any point in time your data remains your data and you can instruct us to remove it from the SMGR. This could be appropriate for example, if something was discovered that renders the data erroneous.</p>
      
    <h3>
      Is the data in the SMGR being backed up?
    </h3>

    <p>The data contained in the SMGR will be integrated in the back-up system of our institute. Thus, a couple of hard-drives failing will not affect the integrity of the SMGR.</p>
      
    <h3>
      Are there any costs associated to sharing via the SMGR?
    </h3>

    <p>No, given the current small size and low maintenance of the SMGR, any fees are inappropriate. The operation of the SMGR is funded by Kurt Mehlhorn and the MPI for Informatics.</p>
    
    <h3>
      Why are there no features such automatic submission system?
    </h3>

    <p>The answer is, that the SMGR as it stands is simply too small to warrant such efforts. Given the very countable size of the research community interested in slime mold networks, it is probably foolish to expect a large amount of contributors out of the blue. As a result, the number of datasets will likely not exceed large numbers in the near future. Given these assumptions, features commonly found in larger repositories, such as automatic upload processes, are simply overkill at the moment. However, such features may well be added in the future provided appropriate growth of the SMGR and associated community feedback. Even large repositories have started small.</p>
    
    <h3>
      What kind of data can I expect to find in the SMGR?
    </h3>

    <p>In the SMGR you will find data revolving around networks formed by slime molds. At present this includes images of such networks and equivalent graph representations. To get an overview on the data sets available, feel free to browse them here.</p>
      
    <h3>
      How may SMGR data be reused?
    </h3>

    <p>SMGR data may be reused in any way, provided license agreements and terms of use of individual data sets are observed. Reuse includes reproduction of known results as well as the realization of new data analysis approaches evolving previously unexplored research questions. When browsing data sets also look for documents indicating open research questions suggested by the contributors of the sets.</p>
      
    <h3>
      How do I cite SMGR data?
    </h3>

    <p>At present data sets in the SMGR are not citable entities. Please cite the scholarly publication the data set is associated with. Thus the original contributors are credited. Appropriate information can be found on the contributor’s page. In addition to that, you are welcome to cite the SMGR itself to give some credit to us.</p>
      
    <h3>
      What quality level can I expect of the data?
    </h3>

    <p>You can expect the data in the SMGR to be of research grade quality. All data is part of some scholarly publication and underwent a peer-review process. We thus trust the involved expert reviewers to ensure that the quality of the data is on par with the standards of its field of origin.</p>
      
    <h3>
      How to I get SMGR data?
    </h3>

    <p>Simply go to our data set page, browse, select and download. Depending on the size of the data you want to download and the speed of your Internet connection the required amount of patience may vary.</p>
    
    <h3>
      Are there any costs associated to using data contained in the SMGR?
    </h3>

    <p>Due to the small size of the SMGR, there are no costs for its users.</p>
    
    <h3>
      I’d like to follow the development of the SMGR. Can you keep me up to data please?
    </h3>

    <p>Absolutely! Feel free to subscribe to the SMGR mailing list. We will announce updates and additions to the SMGR via this <a href=
    "https://lists.mpi-inf.mpg.de/listinfo/smgr">website</a>.</p>
    
    <h3>
      My question is not on this list, how can I contact you?
    </h3>

    <p>Feel free to contact us <a href="contact.php">here</a>.</p>
    
    <h3>
      I’d like to see the SMGR grow. What can I do to help?
    </h3>

    <p>That’s great there are a couple of things that you can do. Consider sharing data if possible and tell your colleagues about this repository and its data.</p>
